# Ceaser_Cipher_ML_Project
The Caesar Cipher Dataset Generator is a Python project that generates random text samples, encrypts them using the Caesar cipher with random shifts, and saves the data in a CSV file. This dataset is ideal for machine learning, cryptography research, and educational purposes, offering labeled data for shift prediction models.
