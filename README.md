# Ceaser Cipher ML Project

This project implements the **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption technique using **Machine Learning**. The goal is to analyze and explore how ML can be leveraged for cryptographic tasks.

## 🚀 Features
- **Caesar Cipher Implementation**: Encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher algorithm.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Use ML techniques to predict the shift value or decrypt text.
- **Dataset Handling**: Process and analyze text data for training.
- **User Interface**: Simple CLI or Web UI (if implemented).

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmoghShukla/Ceaser_Cipher_ML_Project.git
   cd Ceaser_Cipher_ML_Project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the project**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in a given text by a fixed number (shift value).
2. The ML model attempts to learn patterns in encoded texts and predict the shift value or directly decrypt messages.
3. Various models and NLP techniques may be used for decryption.

## 📊 Machine Learning Approach
- **Feature Extraction**: Convert text into numerical representations.
- **Model Training**: Train models to detect patterns in ciphered texts.
- **Evaluation**: Measure accuracy in predicting shift values or decrypting texts.

## 🔥 Future Improvements
- Implement a GUI for better user interaction.
- Expand ML models for more complex cipher systems.
- Improve dataset diversity for better predictions.
